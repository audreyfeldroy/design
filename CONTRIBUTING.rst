Getting Started
---------------

Here's how to set up `design` for local development.

1. Fork the `design` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/design.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv design
    $ cd design/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the tests and flake8::

    $ python -m unittest discover tests
    $ flake8 design
    $ flake8 tests
    $ flake8 examples

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
